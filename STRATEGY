Finding shortest path to the closest fruit!
===========================================

Init Stage (Should be done in that initial 1 minute)

1. Find all junction points (includes forced corners)
2. Find distance of all junction points to each other 
3. Run the all pairs shortest path algorithm on the junction points and store
    the paths
4. Iterate through all the pills, power pills and fruits
5. Find the closest junction point to each of the above item and store it

Exec stage

1. When lambdaman is at a junction point, and there are no more low hanging
    fruits and pills, iterate through all the map elements stored in 5 in the 
    init step. Find element whose junction point is closest to the 
    lambdaman's current junction point
2. Use the all pairs shortest paths stored in 3, to find the path towards that
    closest junction point
3. Go towards the junction point found above
4. Distance to the fruit from this junction point will be a straight line
    (since the forced bends are also considered junctions). Make the lambda man
    move there, and eat the pill
5. Go to step 1

Note: If step 3 in the init state is not possible, an approximate shortest path to a junction can be found at runtime in step 2 of exec stage, by the following greedy strategy
1. Set Lambdaman's current junction point as the source JP.
2. Iterate through all the junction points, which either have the same x
    or same y coordinate as the source JP.
2. Select the JP which is closest to the target JP.
3. Make the lambdaman move to this JP
4. Go to step 1
